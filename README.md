# React_Project 1

- Each branch in this repository contains different React Project. Please try to explore the other branches in this current repository for more stuff.

- Main Branch(Project_1) starts with a Very Basic Project, in which I mostly used functional components, stateManagement, props passing for parent & child communication and implemented child to parent communication, CSS modules, User validations and showed the appropriate error message via model.


-Below are the snaps of final output of Project_1
